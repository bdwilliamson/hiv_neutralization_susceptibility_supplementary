# Data

The data folder contains several types of object:
1. Compiled datasets from CATNAP (`slapnap_*.csv`) for each individual bnAb that is part of a combination of interest
2. HTML documentation on the CATNAP datasets (`metadata_*.html`)

The `.csv` files are used to create the analysis datasets. The analysis datasets are used to obtain the predictions. The predictions are used to estimate prediction performance.
